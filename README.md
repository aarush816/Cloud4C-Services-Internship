# Cloud4C-Services-Internship

## 
During my internship as a Data Analyst Intern, I gained hands-on experience in
 machine learning and deep learning techniques. My responsibilities included
 data inspection, preprocessing, manipulation, and cleaning, along with
 implementing various algorithms. Additionally, I specialized in Convolutional
 Neural Networks (CNNs), working with models such as LeNet, ZfNet, GoogleNet,
 AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, and conducting image and video classification tasks.
